<h2>How to intepret different metrics</h2>
<h5>Monthly GitHub stargazers</h5>
<p>
The amount of GitHub stars is known to be related with media coverage.
For example, if a technology gets new media coverage the number of new stars spikes.
People show interest in a technology by starring it.
But there is no guarantee that this interest will grow into usage or contributions.
For those reasons we consider this metric to be in the 'Hype' category.
</p>

<h5>Monthly StackOverflow questions</h5>
<p>
Formulating and posting a question on StackExchange network requires more work than starring a project on GitHub.
It's more like a public post associated with your internet identity.
It can be downvoted if the question quality is bad or it can be awarded it the quality is good.
Usually people are asking questions when they're already working with the technology and facing a specific situation which they are trying to resolve.
For the reasons above we consider this metric a proxy for usage.

<h5>Monthly lines of code changed</h5>
This metric together with commit count and contributor count show how actively a technology is being developed.
We use together <i>commit count</i> and <i>LOC changed count</i> because a sole metric does not suffice.
For example, some commits are large refactoring commits.
They touch a lot of lines but generated no functional enhancement of a technology.
On the contrary, some projects prefer smaller commits or attract a big community of 'shallow' contributors who mostly fix typos or contribute minor things.
Two metrics in a concert should give a fuller picture.
